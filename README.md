Nodi is a community time bank that makes it easy to share your skills and time with others. Whether you’re offering tutoring, home repairs, or creative workshops, Nodi connects you with people in your community who need your expertise and lets you earn time credits in return. It’s simple, fair, and designed to bring people closer together.

Nodi is my Final Year Project and is a work-in-progress!
